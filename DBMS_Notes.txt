-- Data -> Information or any fact that can be recorded.
-- Database -> It's a collection related data.
-- Data Wharehouse -> Its stores very large or huge data.
-- DBMS (Database Management System) -> It's a software (or) set of programs which are used to define, 
construct and mainpulate (add, edit, update and delete) database.
-- The collection of (DB+DBMS) is called DBS(Database Systems).

### Database Level
1. Conceptual Level (ER Model)
2. Representation Level (Relational Model)
3. Physical Level. ()


/*** ER - Model  (Entity Relationship Model) ***/
-- A basic ER model is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).
-- The ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information structure 
   which can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.
-- Entity - any object or thing in our real world which can be recorded in your db
-- Reationship - A relationship type represents the association between entity types. . association among entities.(verbs)
-- Attributes - Attributes are the properties which define the entity type.
-- Entities and relationships can both have attributes.
-- ER-Model develops a conceptual design for the database.

### Strong entity
It can exist without any other entity. Strong entities are also called independent entities.
Example
Customer(customerid, name, surname)

### Weak entity
Weak entities are also called dependent entities, since it's existence depends on other entities. 
Such entities are represented by a double outline rectangle in the E-R diagram..
Example
Address(addressid, addressName, customerid)


English grammar structure	ER structure
Common noun  	--	Entity type
Proper noun  	--	Entity
Transitive verb   --	Relationship type
Intransitive verb -- 	Attribute type
Adjective		-- 	Attribute for entity
Adverb		--	Attribute for relationship


/*** Relational Model ***/ 
-- Most popular representational model is Relational DBMS.
-- After designing the conceptual model of Database using ER diagram, we need to convert the conceptual model in 
   the relational model which can be implemented using any RDBMS languages like Oracle SQL, MySQL etc.
-- The relational model in DBMS is an abstract model used to organize and manage the data stored in a database.
-- It stores data in two-dimensional inter-related tables, also known as relations in which each row represents 
   an entity and each column represents the properties of the entity.
-- Relational Model represents how data is stored in Relational Databases.
-- A relational database stores data in the form of relations (Two-dimensional tables)
-- Each row in the relation is known as tuple.
-- The number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the relation.
-- The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality.
-- The value which is not known or unavailable is called NULL value. It is represented by blank space.


-- Relation : Two-dimensional table used to store a collection of data elements.
-- Tuple : Row of the relation, depicting a real-world entity.
-- Attribute/Field : Column of the relation, depicting properties that define the relation.
-- Attribute Domain : Set of pre-defined atomic values that an attribute can take i.e., it describes the legal values that an attribute can take.
-- Degree : It is the total number of attributes present in the relation.
-- Cardinality : It specifies the number of entities involved in the relation i.e., it is the total number of rows present in the relation.
-- Relational Schema : It is the logical blueprint of the relation i.e., it describes the design and the structure of the relation. It contains the table name, its attributes, and their types:
-- Relational Instance : It is the collection of records present in the relation at a given time.
-- Relation Key : It is an attribute or a group of attributes that can be used 
   to uniquely identify an entity in a table or to determine the relationship between two tables. 6 types
	1. Candidate Key
	2. Super Key
	3. Composite Key
	4. Primary Key
	5. Alternate Key
	6. Foreign Key

### Cascade Syntax In Sql With Code Examples
DELETE Rules:
1. ON DELETE NO ACTION
2. ON DELETE CASCADE
3. ON DELETE SET NULL
4. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
UPDATE Rules:
1. ON UPDATE NO ACTION
2. ON UPDATE CASCADE
3. ON UPDATE SET NULL
4. ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT


### Constraints in Relational Model
SQL constrains are used to specify rules for the data and limit the type of data that is entered into a table.
These constraints are checked before performing any operation (insertion, deletion and updation) in database. 
If there is a violation in any of constrains, operation will fail. 

Domain Constraints: These are attribute level constraints. An attribute can only take values which lie inside the domain range. 
			  e.g,; If a constrains AGE>0 is applied on STUDENT relation, inserting negative value of AGE will result in failure. 

Key Integrity: Every relation in the database should have atleast one set of attributes which defines a tuple uniquely. 
		   Those set of attributes is called key. e.g.; ROLL_NO in STUDENT is a key. No two students can have same 
		   roll number. So a key has two properties: 
		-- It should be unique for all tuples.
		-- It can’t have NULL values.

Referential Integrity: When one attribute of a relation can only take values from other attribute of same relation or any other relation, 
			     it is called referential integrity.


Types of SQL Constraints
1. NOT NULL -- Records in a column cannot have a NULL value. Every field in this column always has a non-Null value.
		   A null value means that a particular field has been left empty, and values such as zero or blank space do not come under Null values.
2. CHECK -- It ensures that the values in a column statifies a specific conditon/rule given. This constraint limits the values.
3. UNIQUE -- It ensures that the particular column accepts only unique values, and repetitive values are not allowed.
		 We can create multiple UNIQUE constraints on various columns in a table. A UNIQUE constraint allows NULL values to be entered.
4. PRIMARY KEY -- Primary key on a column ensures that the values are NOT NULL and Unique. We can use this to uniquely identify a row in the table.
5. FOREIGN KEY -- This constraint helps the data in one table to establish a relationship with the data in another table in the database. 
			Foreign Key can be a single column or a set of columns. Foreign key on a column refers to the primary key
			of the another table.
6. DEFAULT -- This constraint is used to specify the default value for a particular column in the table. 
		  This way, if there is no value inserted for that column explicitly, the database engine 
		  can always refer to the default value specified and insert that in the column.
7. INDEX --  It is used to create index which helps to retrieve data from the database quickly.












/*** PHP PDO (PHP Data Objects) PHP Extension ***/

https://phpdelusions.net/pdo
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue


-- PDO is a Database access abstraction layer.
-- Works with multiple databases. Especially for OOPS.
-- PDO is db driver (or) PHP extension

### PDO benefits
-- Multiple databased
-- Security/Prepared statements (data prevents from sql injection, separates sql instruction from data)
-- Usability (many helper functions to automate routine operations).
-- Reusability (unified API to access multitude of databases, from SQLite to Oracle).
-- Excellent Error Handling.

### Main PDO Classes 
-- PDO : Represents a connection between PHP and Database
-- PDOStatement : Represents a prepared statement and after executed an associated result.
-- PDOException : Represents errors raised by PDO.

### Creating a PDO instance

try {

$host = 'localhost';
$dbuser = 'root';
$dbpass = '';
$dbname = 'posts';
//set  DSN - Domain Source Name (string).
$dsn = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname";  // database driver, host, db(schema) name.

$options = [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION, PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_OBJ];  //this is optional

$pdo = new PDO($dsn,$dbuser,$dbpass,$options);
$pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE,PDO::FETCH_OBJ); // PDO::FETCH_OBJ , PDO::FETCH_ASSOC
 
-- There are two ways to run a query in PDO. // $pdo->query() and $pdo->prepare()
-- If no variables or placeholders are going to be used in the query, you can use PDO::query().
PDO Query ::
$stmt = $pdo->query('select * from posts');
print_r($stmt->fetchAll()); // get all records at once
while($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))
{
		print_r($row);
}

PDO prepared statements. Pretection from SQL injections ::

-- FLOW :: new PDO($dsn,$dbuser,$dbpass,$options)->prepare($query)->execute($placeholders)->fetch/fetchAll();
-- Note that PDO supports positional(?) and named(:) placeholders.
-- You cannot mix positional and named placeholders in the same query.
-- Having a query with placeholders, you have to prepare it, using the PDO::prepare() method. This function will return PDOStatement.
-- if you want to get the number of affected rows : $count = $stmt->rowCount();

	A. POSITIONAL placeholders (or) params  (sensitive to the order of arguments)
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = ?');
		$stmt->execute([5]);
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = ? && title = ?');
		$stmt->execute([3,'testtt']); // basic or regular array
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

	B. NAMED placeholders (or) params (more verbose, allow random binding order).
	1. add record
	$title = 'test4567';
	$body = 'test4567 body goes here.....';
	$author = 'author4567';
	$stmt = $pdo->prepare('insert into posts (title,body,author) values (:titlevar, :bodyvar, :authorvar)');
	$stmt->execute(['titlevar'=>$title,'bodyvar'=>$body,'authorvar'=>$author]); // associative array

	2. read record
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = :id && title = :title');
		$stmt->execute(['id'=>3,'title'=>'testtt']);
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts');
		$stmt->execute([]);
		print_r($stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC));

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts order by id desc');
		$stmt->execute([]);
		print_r($stmt->fetchAll());

	3. update recored
		
		var_dump($stmt);

	// GET ROW COUNT
		$sql = 'select * from posts where is_published = ?';
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
		$stmt->execute([1]);
		echo 'Rows count '.$stmt->rowCount();
	
	search data
	$search = '%test%';
	$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where title like ?');
	$stmt->execute([$search]);
	print_r($stmt->fetchAll());


 } catch (PDOException $e) {
    // throw new pdoDbException($e);
    echo $e->getMessage();
    // print_r($e);
}

### Fetch modes in PDO
PDO::FETCH_NUM returns enumerated array
PDO::FETCH_ASSOC returns associative array
PDO::FETCH_BOTH - both of the above
PDO::FETCH_OBJ returns object
PDO::FETCH_LAZY allows all three (numeric associative and object) methods without memory overhead.
PDO::FETCH_CLASS  create an object of particular class
PDOStatement::fetchAll() returns an array that consists of all the rows returned by the query.


-- Note that default mode is PDO::FETCH_BOTH, but you can change it using PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE configuration option 
   as shown in the connection example. Thus, once set, it can be omitted most of the time.
   $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE,PDO::FETCH_OBJ);

Getting a column:
$data = $pdo->query('SELECT name FROM users')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_COLUMN);
/* array (
  0 => 'John',
  1 => 'Mike',
  2 => 'Mary',
  3 => 'Kathy',
)*/


Getting key-value pairs.
-- Also extremely useful format, when we need to get the same column, but indexed not by numbers in order 
   but by another field. Here goes PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR constant:
-- Note that you have to select only two columns for this mode, first of which has to be unique.
$data = $pdo->query('SELECT id, name FROM users')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR);
/* array (
  104 => 'John',
  110 => 'Mike',
  120 => 'Mary',
  121 => 'Kathy',
)*/

-- Getting rows indexed by unique field : PDO::FETCH_UNIQUE
-- Getting rows grouped by some field
   PDO::FETCH_GROUP will group rows into a nested array, where indexes will be unique values from the first column, 
   and values will be arrays similar to ones returned by regular fetchAll().


Error handling. Exceptions
$dbh->setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );

-- Getting row count with PDO: PDOstatement::rowCount()
   $stmt->rowCount() , used to check resulted query count. 
   One should never use the rowCount() to count rows in database!. For rows count in db use count(*) in sql query.

-- Prepared statements and LIKE clause
   $search = "%$search%";
   $stmt  = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE ?");
   $stmt->execute([$search]);
   $data = $stmt->fetchAll();

   
   

### Binding methods
-- To set data type explicitly
-- For explicit binding we have two methods.  bindValue() and bindParam().
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue

Unlike PDOStatement::bindValue(), the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that PDOStatement::execute() is called.
Use bindParam to insert multiple rows with one time binding:
bindParam: reference
bindValue: variable

$allUserStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn,$qry);
mysqli_stmt_execute($allUserStatement);
$getResult = mysqli_stmt_get_result($allUserStatement);
while($rows = mysqli_fetch_assoc($getResult))
{
	print_r($rows);
}
?>


Fetch Single record without bind_result:
<?php
$userName = "Conner";
$qry = 'select id, first_name,last_name from customers where first_name = ?';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 's',$userName);

echo "id: ".$getData['id'];
echo "<br>";
echo "First name: ".$getData['first_name'];
echo "<br>";
echo "Last name: ".$getData['last_name'];
echo "<br>";
?>


Fetch Single record with bind_result:
<?php
$userName = "Conner";
$qry = 'select id, first_name,last_name from customers where first_name = ?';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 's',$userName);

echo "id: ".$id;
echo "<br>";
echo "First name: ".$first_name;
echo "<br>";
echo "Last name: ".$last_name;
echo "<br>";
?>

Fetch Single record with multiple bind_param column:
<?php
$id = 93;
$firstName = "Conner";
$lastName = "Krajcik";
$qry = 'select * from customers where id = ? and first_name = ? and last_name = ? ';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 'iss',$id,$firstName,$lastName);
mysqli_stmt_execute($userStatement);

//Object oriented style without PHP variables
// $mysqli = new mysqli(host, username, password, dbname, port, socket);
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$result = $mysqli->query($query);

When a query is entirely hardcoded, i.e. no PHP variables are used in it, one can use the query() function. 
It already returns the mysqli_result object, so the code can be much simpler, like

$menu = $db->query("SELECT * FROM menu")->fetch_all();
$count = $db->query("SELECT count(*) FROM users")->fetch_row()[0];

without variables
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$query = "select * from posts";
$result = $mysqli->query($query);
print_r($result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC));

$query = "select * from posts where is_published = 1";
$result = $mysqli->query($query);
print_r($result->fetch_assoc());
print_r($result->fetch_object());

Number of rows affected by data modification queries
$db->query("DELETE FROM users");
echo $db->affected_rows();
To get result rows count SELECT count(*) must be used instead of num_rows.




### Executing queries with PHP variables. MYSQLI OBJECT PREPARED STATEMENTS
1. Prepare -> Execute -> Get Result -> Fetch (OR)
2. Prepare -> Bind -> Execute -> Get Result -> Fetch 

we need to get the query result so it can be used to fetch the returned data
$con = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$stmt = $con->prepare($query)
$stmt->bind_param()
$stmt->execute()
$result = $stmt->get_result();
echo $result->num_rows; // return result rows


To fetch rows or data
-- fetch_row() returns enumerated array, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_assoc() returns associative array, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_object() returns an object, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_all return all result 
   $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC) : returns associative array data
   $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_BOTH) :  returns associative and enumerated array

Get array of objects
$result_object_array = [];
while($row = $result->fetch_object()){
	$result_object_array[] = $row;
}
print_r($result_object_array);


Getting multiple rows in a loop
$users = [];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 0, 10";
$result = $db->query($sql);
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $users[] = $row;

-- What is the best column type for a United States ZIP code?
	1. valid US zip codes (12345-6789  or 12345).
	2. use MEDIUMINT (5) UNSIGNED ZEROFILL  for 5 digit zip codes. This preserves any leading 0s and it only uses 3 bytes.
	   The ZEROFILL option is necessary for zip codes with leading zeros.
	3. VARCHAR data type because in some countries zip codes are used as alphanumeric and in other places as an integer.
	   varchar(10).

-- CONCAT(str1,str2,...) : Returns the string that results from concatenating the arguments. May have one or more arguments.
   CONCAT() returns NULL if any argument is NULL.
   SELECT CONCAT('My', 'S', 'QL');  -> 'MySQL'
   SELECT CONCAT('My', NULL, 'QL'); -> NULL
   SELECT CONCAT('My', '---', 'QL'); -> 
-- CONCAT_WS(separator,str1,str2,...) : CONCAT_WS() stands for Concatenate With Separator and is a special form of CONCAT(). 
   The first argument is the separator for the rest of the arguments. The separator is added between the strings to be concatenated.
   If the separator is NULL, the result is NULL.


-- unsigned-integer : A specific data type that uses all its bits to represent an integer value, consequently only 0 or a positive number.


Select rows with even or odd values in SQL
https://tableplus.com/blog/2019/09/select-rows-odd-even-value.html
-- To find and return the records with the odd or even values, the most simple way is to check the remainder when we divide the column value by 2. 
   When the remainder is 0, that’s an even number, otherwise, that’s an odd number.
-- In PostgreSQL, My SQL, and Oracle, we use MOD function to check the remainder.
-- To find rows where a specified column has even values:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE mod(column_name,2) = 0;
-- To find rows where a specified column has odd values:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE mod(column_name,2) <> 0;


Mysql replace() function ::
-- REPLACE [INTO] table_name(column_list) VALUES(value_list);  
-- REPLACE works exactly like INSERT, except that if an old row in the table has the same value as a new row for a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, 
the old row is deleted before the new row is inserted
-- UPDATE c2m_core_config_data SET columnName = REPLACE(columnName, 'old value', 'new value') WHERE INSTR(columnName, 'old value') > 0;
-- UPDATE c2m_core_config_data SET value = REPLACE(value, 'c2msrvr.i95-dev.com/sudh236', 'c2msrvr.i95-dev.com/naga236') WHERE INSTR(value, 'c2msrvr.i95-dev.com/naga236') > 0;
