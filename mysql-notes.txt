-- Data -> Information or any fact that can be recorded.
-- Database -> It's a collection related data.
-- Data Wharehouse -> Its stores very large or huge data.
-- DBMS (Database Management System) -> It's a software (or) set of programs which are used to define, 
construct and mainpulate (add, edit, update and delete) database.
-- The collection of (DB+DBMS) is called DBS(Database Systems).

### Database Level
1. Conceptual Level (ER Model)
2. Representation Level (Relational Model)
3. Physical Level. ()


/*** ER - Model  (Entity Relationship Model) ***/
-- A basic ER model is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).
-- The ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information structure 
   which can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database.
-- Entity - any object or thing in our real world which can be recorded in your db
-- Reationship - A relationship type represents the association between entity types. . association among entities.(verbs)
-- Attributes - Attributes are the properties which define the entity type.
-- Entities and relationships can both have attributes.
-- ER-Model develops a conceptual design for the database.

### Strong entity
It can exist without any other entity. Strong entities are also called independent entities.
Example
Customer(customerid, name, surname)

### Weak entity
Weak entities are also called dependent entities, since it's existence depends on other entities. 
Such entities are represented by a double outline rectangle in the E-R diagram..
Example
Address(addressid, addressName, customerid)


English grammar structure	ER structure
Common noun  	--	Entity type
Proper noun  	--	Entity
Transitive verb   --	Relationship type
Intransitive verb -- 	Attribute type
Adjective		-- 	Attribute for entity
Adverb		--	Attribute for relationship


/*** Relational Model ***/ 
-- Most popular representational model is Relational DBMS.
-- After designing the conceptual model of Database using ER diagram, we need to convert the conceptual model in 
   the relational model which can be implemented using any RDBMS languages like Oracle SQL, MySQL etc.
-- The relational model in DBMS is an abstract model used to organize and manage the data stored in a database.
-- It stores data in two-dimensional inter-related tables, also known as relations in which each row represents 
   an entity and each column represents the properties of the entity.
-- Relational Model represents how data is stored in Relational Databases.
-- A relational database stores data in the form of relations (Two-dimensional tables)
-- Each row in the relation is known as tuple.
-- The number of attributes in the relation is known as degree of the relation.
-- The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality.
-- The value which is not known or unavailable is called NULL value. It is represented by blank space.


-- Relation : Two-dimensional table used to store a collection of data elements.
-- Tuple : Row of the relation, depicting a real-world entity.
-- Attribute/Field : Column of the relation, depicting properties that define the relation.
-- Attribute Domain : Set of pre-defined atomic values that an attribute can take i.e., it describes the legal values that an attribute can take.
-- Degree : It is the total number of attributes present in the relation.
-- Cardinality : It specifies the number of entities involved in the relation i.e., it is the total number of rows present in the relation.
-- Relational Schema : It is the logical blueprint of the relation i.e., it describes the design and the structure of the relation. It contains the table name, its attributes, and their types:
-- Relational Instance : It is the collection of records present in the relation at a given time.
-- Relation Key : It is an attribute or a group of attributes that can be used 
   to uniquely identify an entity in a table or to determine the relationship between two tables. 6 types
	1. Candidate Key
	2. Super Key
	3. Composite Key
	4. Primary Key
	5. Alternate Key
	6. Foreign Key

### Cascade Syntax In Sql With Code Examples
DELETE Rules:
1. ON DELETE NO ACTION
2. ON DELETE CASCADE
3. ON DELETE SET NULL
4. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT
UPDATE Rules:
1. ON UPDATE NO ACTION
2. ON UPDATE CASCADE
3. ON UPDATE SET NULL
4. ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT


### Constraints in Relational Model
SQL constrains are used to specify rules for the data and limit the type of data that is entered into a table.
These constraints are checked before performing any operation (insertion, deletion and updation) in database. 
If there is a violation in any of constrains, operation will fail. 

Domain Constraints: These are attribute level constraints. An attribute can only take values which lie inside the domain range. 
			  e.g,; If a constrains AGE>0 is applied on STUDENT relation, inserting negative value of AGE will result in failure. 

Key Integrity: Every relation in the database should have atleast one set of attributes which defines a tuple uniquely. 
		   Those set of attributes is called key. e.g.; ROLL_NO in STUDENT is a key. No two students can have same 
		   roll number. So a key has two properties: 
		-- It should be unique for all tuples.
		-- It can’t have NULL values.

Referential Integrity: When one attribute of a relation can only take values from other attribute of same relation or any other relation, 
			     it is called referential integrity.


Types of SQL Constraints
1. NOT NULL -- Records in a column cannot have a NULL value. Every field in this column always has a non-Null value.
		   A null value means that a particular field has been left empty, and values such as zero or blank space do not come under Null values.
2. CHECK -- It ensures that the values in a column statifies a specific conditon/rule given. This constraint limits the values.
3. UNIQUE -- It ensures that the particular column accepts only unique values, and repetitive values are not allowed.
		 We can create multiple UNIQUE constraints on various columns in a table. A UNIQUE constraint allows NULL values to be entered.
4. PRIMARY KEY -- Primary key on a column ensures that the values are NOT NULL and Unique. We can use this to uniquely identify a row in the table.
5. FOREIGN KEY -- This constraint helps the data in one table to establish a relationship with the data in another table in the database. 
			Foreign Key can be a single column or a set of columns. Foreign key on a column refers to the primary key
			of the another table.
6. DEFAULT -- This constraint is used to specify the default value for a particular column in the table. 
		  This way, if there is no value inserted for that column explicitly, the database engine 
		  can always refer to the default value specified and insert that in the column.
7. INDEX --  It is used to create index which helps to retrieve data from the database quickly.






/*** PHP PDO (PHP Data Objects) PHP Extension ***/

https://phpdelusions.net/pdo
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue


-- PDO is a Database access abstraction layer.
-- Works with multiple databases. Especially for OOPS.
-- PDO is db driver (or) PHP extension

### PDO benefits
-- Multiple databased
-- Security/Prepared statements (data prevents from sql injection, separates sql instruction from data)
-- Usability (many helper functions to automate routine operations).
-- Reusability (unified API to access multitude of databases, from SQLite to Oracle).
-- Excellent Error Handling.

### Main PDO Classes 
-- PDO : Represents a connection between PHP and Database
-- PDOStatement : Represents a prepared statement and after executed an associated result.
-- PDOException : Represents errors raised by PDO.

### Creating a PDO instance

try {

$host = 'localhost';
$dbuser = 'root';
$dbpass = '';
$dbname = 'posts';
//set  DSN - Domain Source Name (string).
$dsn = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname";  // database driver, host, db(schema) name.

$options = [PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE => PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION, PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE => PDO::FETCH_OBJ];  //this is optional

$pdo = new PDO($dsn,$dbuser,$dbpass,$options);
$pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE,PDO::FETCH_OBJ); // PDO::FETCH_OBJ , PDO::FETCH_ASSOC
 
-- There are two ways to run a query in PDO. // $pdo->query() and $pdo->prepare()
-- If no variables or placeholders are going to be used in the query, you can use PDO::query().
PDO Query ::
$stmt = $pdo->query('select * from posts');
print_r($stmt->fetchAll()); // get all records at once
while($row = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))
{
		print_r($row);
}

PDO prepared statements. Pretection from SQL injections ::

-- FLOW :: new PDO($dsn,$dbuser,$dbpass,$options)->prepare($query)->execute($placeholders)->fetch/fetchAll();
-- Note that PDO supports positional(?) and named(:) placeholders.
-- You cannot mix positional and named placeholders in the same query.
-- Having a query with placeholders, you have to prepare it, using the PDO::prepare() method. This function will return PDOStatement.
-- if you want to get the number of affected rows : $count = $stmt->rowCount();

	A. POSITIONAL placeholders (or) params  (sensitive to the order of arguments)
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = ?');
		$stmt->execute([5]);
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = ? && title = ?');
		$stmt->execute([3,'testtt']); // basic or regular array
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

	B. NAMED placeholders (or) params (more verbose, allow random binding order).
	1. add record
	$title = 'test4567';
	$body = 'test4567 body goes here.....';
	$author = 'author4567';
	$stmt = $pdo->prepare('insert into posts (title,body,author) values (:titlevar, :bodyvar, :authorvar)');
	$stmt->execute(['titlevar'=>$title,'bodyvar'=>$body,'authorvar'=>$author]); // associative array

	2. read record
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where id = :id && title = :title');
		$stmt->execute(['id'=>3,'title'=>'testtt']);
		print_r($stmt->fetch());

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts');
		$stmt->execute([]);
		print_r($stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC));

		$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts order by id desc');
		$stmt->execute([]);
		print_r($stmt->fetchAll());

	3. update recored
		
		var_dump($stmt);

	// GET ROW COUNT
		$sql = 'select * from posts where is_published = ?';
		$stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);
		$stmt->execute([1]);
		echo 'Rows count '.$stmt->rowCount();
	
	search data
	$search = '%test%';
	$stmt = $pdo->prepare('select * from posts where title like ?');
	$stmt->execute([$search]);
	print_r($stmt->fetchAll());


 } catch (PDOException $e) {
    // throw new pdoDbException($e);
    echo $e->getMessage();
    // print_r($e);
}

### Fetch modes in PDO
PDO::FETCH_NUM returns enumerated array
PDO::FETCH_ASSOC returns associative array
PDO::FETCH_BOTH - both of the above
PDO::FETCH_OBJ returns object
PDO::FETCH_LAZY allows all three (numeric associative and object) methods without memory overhead.
PDO::FETCH_CLASS  create an object of particular class
PDOStatement::fetchAll() returns an array that consists of all the rows returned by the query.


-- Note that default mode is PDO::FETCH_BOTH, but you can change it using PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE configuration option 
   as shown in the connection example. Thus, once set, it can be omitted most of the time.
   $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE,PDO::FETCH_OBJ);

Getting a column:
$data = $pdo->query('SELECT name FROM users')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_COLUMN);
/* array (
  0 => 'John',
  1 => 'Mike',
  2 => 'Mary',
  3 => 'Kathy',
)*/


Getting key-value pairs.
-- Also extremely useful format, when we need to get the same column, but indexed not by numbers in order 
   but by another field. Here goes PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR constant:
-- Note that you have to select only two columns for this mode, first of which has to be unique.
$data = $pdo->query('SELECT id, name FROM users')->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_KEY_PAIR);
/* array (
  104 => 'John',
  110 => 'Mike',
  120 => 'Mary',
  121 => 'Kathy',
)*/

-- Getting rows indexed by unique field : PDO::FETCH_UNIQUE
-- Getting rows grouped by some field
   PDO::FETCH_GROUP will group rows into a nested array, where indexes will be unique values from the first column, 
   and values will be arrays similar to ones returned by regular fetchAll().


Error handling. Exceptions
$dbh->setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );

-- Getting row count with PDO: PDOstatement::rowCount()
   $stmt->rowCount() , used to check resulted query count. 
   One should never use the rowCount() to count rows in database!. For rows count in db use count(*) in sql query.

-- Prepared statements and LIKE clause
   $search = "%$search%";
   $stmt  = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE ?");
   $stmt->execute([$search]);
   $data = $stmt->fetchAll();

   
   

### Binding methods
-- To set data type explicitly
-- For explicit binding we have two methods.  bindValue() and bindParam().
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1179874/what-is-the-difference-between-bindparam-and-bindvalue

Unlike PDOStatement::bindValue(), the variable is bound as a reference and will only be evaluated at the time that PDOStatement::execute() is called.
Use bindParam to insert multiple rows with one time binding:
bindParam: reference
bindValue: variable

-- mysqli_prepare($connection, $query) : Prepares the SQL query, and returns a statement handle to be used for further operations on the statement.
						     It takes 2 parameters. $connection is a connection string and $query is a sql query.
-- mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt,$types. $variable1) : Binds variables to a prepared statement as parameters.$stmt is a statement identifier. $types is a string that 
									contain string type for corresponding bind variables. List of string type is given below. 
									$variable1 is a number of variable and length of a string $types.

-- mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt) : Gets a result set from a prepared statement. $stmt is a statement identifier
-- mysqli_stmt_fetch($stmt) : Fetch results from a prepared statement into the bound variables.$stmt is a statement identifier
Fetch all records :
<?php
$qry = 'select * from customers';
$allUserStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn,$qry);
mysqli_stmt_execute($allUserStatement);
$getResult = mysqli_stmt_get_result($allUserStatement);
while($rows = mysqli_fetch_assoc($getResult))
{
	print_r($rows);
}
?>


Fetch Single record without bind_result:
<?php
$userName = "Conner";
$qry = 'select id, first_name,last_name from customers where first_name = ?';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 's',$userName);

$result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($userStatement);
$getData = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
 
echo "id: ".$getData['id'];
echo "<br>";
echo "First name: ".$getData['first_name'];
echo "<br>";
echo "Last name: ".$getData['last_name'];
echo "<br>";
?>


Fetch Single record with bind_result:
<?php
$userName = "Conner";
$qry = 'select id, first_name,last_name from customers where first_name = ?';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 's',$userName);
mysqli_stmt_execute($userStatement);
mysqli_stmt_bind_result($userStatement, $id, $first_name, $last_name);
mysqli_stmt_fetch($userStatement);
 
echo "id: ".$id;
echo "<br>";
echo "First name: ".$first_name;
echo "<br>";
echo "Last name: ".$last_name;
echo "<br>";
?>

Fetch Single record with multiple bind_param column:
<?php
$id = 93;
$firstName = "Conner";
$lastName = "Krajcik";
$qry = 'select * from customers where id = ? and first_name = ? and last_name = ? ';
$userStatement = mysqli_prepare($conn, $qry);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($userStatement, 'iss',$id,$firstName,$lastName);
mysqli_stmt_execute($userStatement);
$result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($userStatement);
$getData = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
print_r($getData);
?>




//Object oriented style without PHP variables
// $mysqli = new mysqli(host, username, password, dbname, port, socket);
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$result = $mysqli->query($query);

When a query is entirely hardcoded, i.e. no PHP variables are used in it, one can use the query() function. 
It already returns the mysqli_result object, so the code can be much simpler, like

$menu = $db->query("SELECT * FROM menu")->fetch_all();
$count = $db->query("SELECT count(*) FROM users")->fetch_row()[0];

without variables
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$query = "select * from posts";
$result = $mysqli->query($query);
print_r($result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC));

$query = "select * from posts where is_published = 1";
$result = $mysqli->query($query);
print_r($result->fetch_assoc());
print_r($result->fetch_object());

Number of rows affected by data modification queries
$db->query("DELETE FROM users");
echo $db->affected_rows();
To get result rows count SELECT count(*) must be used instead of num_rows.




### Executing queries with PHP variables. MYSQLI OBJECT PREPARED STATEMENTS
1. Prepare -> Execute -> Get Result -> Fetch (OR)
2. Prepare -> Bind -> Execute -> Get Result -> Fetch 

we need to get the query result so it can be used to fetch the returned data
$con = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
$stmt = $con->prepare($query)
$stmt->bind_param()
$stmt->execute()
$result = $stmt->get_result();
echo $result->num_rows; // return result rows


To fetch rows or data
-- fetch_row() returns enumerated array, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_assoc() returns associative array, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_object() returns an object, to fetch just a single row
-- fetch_all return all result 
   $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC) : returns associative array data
   $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_BOTH) :  returns associative and enumerated array

$stmt = $mysqli->prepare($query);
$stmt->bind_param('is', $ReleaseID, $initialType);
$stmt->execute();
$res = $stmt->get_result();
$row = $res->fetch_all(MYSQLI_BOTH);
return $row;


Get array of objects
$result_object_array = [];
while($row = $result->fetch_object()){
	$result_object_array[] = $row;
}
print_r($result_object_array);


Getting multiple rows in a loop
$users = [];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 0, 10";
$result = $db->query($sql);
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $users[] = $row;
}

Select rows with even or odd values in SQL
https://tableplus.com/blog/2019/09/select-rows-odd-even-value.html
-- To find and return the records with the odd or even values, the most simple way is to check the remainder when we divide the column value by 2. 
   When the remainder is 0, that’s an even number, otherwise, that’s an odd number.
-- In PostgreSQL, My SQL, and Oracle, we use MOD function to check the remainder.
-- To find rows where a specified column has even values:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE mod(column_name,2) = 0;
-- To find rows where a specified column has odd values:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE mod(column_name,2) <> 0;


Mysql replace() function ::
-- REPLACE [INTO] table_name(column_list) VALUES(value_list);  
-- REPLACE works exactly like INSERT, except that if an old row in the table has the same value as a new row for a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE index, 
the old row is deleted before the new row is inserted
-- UPDATE c2m_core_config_data SET columnName = REPLACE(columnName, 'old value', 'new value') WHERE INSTR(columnName, 'old value') > 0;

timestamp vs datetime
timestamp -- Timestamps in MySQL are generally used to track changes to records, and are often updated every time the record is changed
datetime -- If you want to store a specific (custom) value you should use a datetime field.
DATETIME does not support timezone information, while TIMESTAMP can store timezone information. This means that if you need to store date and time values with timezone information, TIMESTAMP would be the better choice.
In terms of performance, TIMESTAMP is generally faster than DATETIME.  timestamp takes less bytes;

### Mysql users and authentication
-- As of MySQL 8.0.34, the mysql_native_password authentication plugin is deprecated and subject to removal in a future version of MySQL.
-- In MySQL 8.0, `caching_sha2_password` is the default authentication plugin rather than mysql_native_password.
-- The server-side caching_sha2_password plugin is built into the server and it does not need to be loaded explicitly.

-- The default authentication plugin is defined by the default_authentication_plugin system variable. 
   We can use the SHOW VARIABLES statement to determine which authentication plugin is default.
       SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'default_authentication_plugin';

-- The default authentication plugin can be changed in MySQL configuration file. After that, MySQL server must be restarted.
    default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password
    
-- The authentication plugin which will be used to authenticate the user is stored in the mysql.user system table.
     SELECT user, host, plugin, authentication_string FROM mysql.user;
 
-- create and update users & password
	CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pwd123';
	CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'pwd123';
	ALTER USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'psw123';
	create user 'MySql'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH caching_sha2_password BY 'MySql@123';
 
 
SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_secure_password';

CREATE USER 'magento2'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'magento2'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

CREATE USER jazz_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE jazz_music TO jazz_user;


-- To reload the grant tables in MySQL
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

### Mysql joins and types
-- https://www.devart.com/white-papers-landing/types-of-joins-in-mysql.html
-- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
-- Types of joins
	1. Inner Join (or) Join
	2. Outer Joins
	   a. left outer join (or) left join
	   b. right outer join (or) right join
	3. Full outer join (Inner Joins + remaining from left + remaining right)
	4. Cross Join
	5. Self Join
	6. Natural Join


-- In MySQL, there is no direct support for a full outer join. We achieve using left join, right join with UNION clause.

movies (id, name, release_date, budget, language, rating, genre)
directors (id, name, remuniration )
actors (id, name, gender, age, remuniration, pan_india_star)

### Mysql storage engines and types
-- Database engines are MySQL components that can handle SQL operations like create, read, update data from a database. There are two types of engines in 
   MySQL:  transactional and non-transactional. `InnoDB` is the default engine for MySQL 5.5 and above versions
   
-- MyISAM : 
	 It is the default engine for MySQL DBMS versions prior to 5.5. MyISAM is a high-speed storage and retrieval storage engine. 
	 It doesn’t support transactions.
-- InnoDB : 
	InnoDB is a storage engine for DBMS MySQL and MariaDB.It is the default storage engine for MySQL versions 5.5 and higher. 
	It replaced MyISAM as the default engine.
-- MEMEORY : 
	It is considered to be the fastest engine used to usually create temporary tables in memory (also known as HEAP). 
	Thus data is lost when the database is restarted.
-- CSV :
	It is used to store CSV format in a text file. It is always compiled into the MySQL server. 
	It is lightweight and can be easily imported into spreadsheet programs.

### 	Mysql Indexes [ PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, FULLTEXT ]

-- Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly.
-- Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. 
   The larger the table, the more this costs.
-- In SQL, an index key refers to one or more columns in a table that are used to create an index.
-- An index is a data structure that provides a quick lookup of rows in a table based on the values in the indexed columns.
-- It helps improve the performance of SELECT queries, as it allows the database to locate and retrieve specific rows more efficiently.

-- Indexes allow a new access method to the same data. Indices are stored on disk, not memory. 
-- MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, and FULLTEXT) are stored in B-trees. 

-- Input/Output(I/O) cost is reduced by indexing.

-- An index is usually maintained as a B+ Tree on disk & in-memory, and any index is stored in blocks on disk. 
   These blocks are called index blocks. The entries in the index block are always sorted on the index/search key. 
   The leaf index block of the index contains a row locator

-- Cardinality : Cardinality refers to the uniqueness of data values in a column or set of columns within a table.
   It represents the number of distinct values in a column compared to the total number of rows in the table.
   3 Types : High Cardinality, Medium Cardinality, Low Cardinality

-- Full-text indexes are created on text-based columns (CHAR, VARCHAR, or TEXT columns) to speed up queries and DML operations on data 
   contained within those columns.
-- A full-text index is defined as part of a CREATE TABLE statement or added to an existing table using ALTER TABLE or CREATE INDEX.

-- Spatial Index



-- Index Commands
	show index from project.users;
	create index email_index on project.users(email);
	drop index email_index on project.users;

				MySql Views
-- A database view is a virtual table or logical table which is defined as a SQL SELECT query with joins.
-- When the data of the table changes, the view reflects that changes as well.

# Advantages of database view :
  1. A database view allows you to simplify complex queries.
  2. A database view helps limit data access to specific users.
  3. A database view provides extra security layer.
  4. A database view enables computed columns.
  5. Database view enables backward compatibility
