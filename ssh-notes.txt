					SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell)
					
-- SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, 
   a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.					

-- Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between 
   two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.
   
-- An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 22.

-- Install openssh-server on ubuntu
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server      
	
	check running status
	sudo systemctl status ssh (or) sudo service ssh status
	
	
-- To configure ssh options
   cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep Port


-- If your Ubuntu system has a firewall enabled, such as UFW, CSF or even iptables rules that block the SSH port. Youâ€™ll need to allow SSH connections. 
   sudo ufw allow ssh   // This command will enable SSH traffic on the default SSH port (22).
   sudo ufw status   // to check ssh status 
   
-- To allow the port 22 in your iptables, you can run the following command:
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

-- Connect remote servers vis SSH
   ssh username@hostname_or_IP
   ssh -p port_number username@IP_address
