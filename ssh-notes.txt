					SSH (Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell)
					
-- SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, 
   a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.					

-- Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between 
   two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet.
   
-- An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 22.

-- Install openssh-server on ubuntu
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install openssh-server      
	
	check running status
	sudo systemctl status ssh (or) sudo service ssh status
