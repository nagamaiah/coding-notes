https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

##Install using the repository
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
    
    
    

-- After the installation is complete, start the Docker service and enable it to start automatically on boot
	sudo systemctl start docker
	sudo systemctl enable docker
	
	sudo systemctl status docker




If you want to run docker as non-root user then you need to add it to the docker group.

Create the docker group if it does not exist
$ sudo groupadd docker
Add your user to the docker group.
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Log in to the new docker group (to avoid having to log out / log in again; but if not enough, try to reboot):
$ newgrp docker
