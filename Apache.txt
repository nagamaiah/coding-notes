			Apache Virtual Host

1. Virtual Host refers to the practice of running more than one web site(company.example1.com, company.example2.com) on a single machine.
	a. Name-based virtual hosts (More than one web site per IP address).
	b. IP-based virtual hosts (An IP address for each web site).

2. Name-based virtual hosting is usually simpler, since you need only configure your DNS server to map each hostname to the correct IP address
   and then configure the Apache HTTP Server to recognize the different hostnames.

3. If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your machine you can setup VirtualHosts containers for them. Most configurations use
   only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about IP addresses.

3. Configuration directive
	a. <VirtualHost>
	b. ServerName
	c. ServerAlias
	d. ServerPath
	e. ServerAdmin
	f. ErrorLog
	g. CustomLog

4. To setup VH need to edit two files
	a. C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
		<VirtualHost *:80>
		  DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
		  ServerName localhost
		</VirtualHost>

		<VirtualHost *:80>
		  DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/Laravel57/public"
		  ServerName dev-lsapp.com
		</VirtualHost>

	b. Open notepad as administrator and open file  C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc , view all files in the right corner -> find hosts file
         127.0.0.1 localhost
	   127.0.0.1 lsapp.dev (server name from httpd-vhosts.conf file).

URL -> Uniform Resource Locator (Web Address or Web Site).
href -> Hypertext Referece (used to create a link to another page and identify sections within a document) (HTML attribute of anchor <a> tag).
HTTP -> Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTPS -> HTTP Secure uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate to encrypt the connection between the end user and the server.
HTTPS is vital to prorecting sensitive information. such as passwords, CC numbers and identity data from unauthorized acess.
HTTPS uses TCP/IP port numbers 443 by default, whereas HTTP uses 'port 80'.
DNS -> Domain Name System
Protocols include http, https, ftps, mailto and file.

Parts of URL  -> https://www.techorg.com/post/search/query?name=cruce&age=30
https -> the protocol
www.techorg.com -> host name (or) domain name
post/search/query -> path name
?name=cruce&age=30 -> query
name and age  -> parameters

The URL mailto:president@whitehouse.gov initiates a new email addressed to the mailbox president in the domain whitehouse.gov
The URL ftp://www.companyname.com/whitepapers/widgets.ps specifies the use of the FTP protocol to download a file.
