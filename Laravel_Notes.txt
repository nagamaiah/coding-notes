

1. Laravel is a php framework. It has many resources to learn and code.

2. We have to install composer to develop a laravel app.

3. You can create a new project by using the command.  >>  composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name.

4. Use serve artisan command to run your app. >>  php artisan serve.

5. All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the config directory.

6. The majority of your application is housed in the app directory.

7. Think of the Console and Http directories as providing an API into the core of your application. 

8. The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the Http directory contains your controllers, middleware, and forms requests.

9. php artisan make:listener command generates a Listeners directory. The Listeners directory contains the classes that handle your events.

10. Think of the Kernel as being a big black box that represents your entire application. Feed it HTTP requests and it will return HTTP responses.

11. Service providers are truly the key to bootstrapping a Laravel application. The application instance is created, the service providers are registered, 
    and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application. It's really that simple!

12. The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.

13. Class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.

14. Vendor directory where all composer dependencies are installed.

	app/Providers => Contains service providers.
	config  => Contains configurations for different areas like application,database,filesystem,mail,session,view,services and auth etc,.
	database => Contains Model related files. factories, migrations and seeds.
