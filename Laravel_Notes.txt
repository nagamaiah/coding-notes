

1. Laravel is a php framework. It has many resources to learn and code.

2. We have to install composer to develop a laravel app.

3. You can create a new project by using the command.  >>  composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name.

4. Use serve artisan command to run your app. >>  php artisan serve.

5. All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the config directory.

6. The majority of your application is housed in the app directory.

7. Think of the Console and Http directories as providing an API into the core of your application. 

8. The Console directory contains all of your Artisan commands, while the Http directory contains your controllers, middleware, and forms requests.

9. php artisan make:listener command generates a Listeners directory. The Listeners directory contains the classes that handle your events.

10. Think of the Kernel as being a big black box that represents your entire application. Feed it HTTP requests and it will return HTTP responses.

11. Service providers are truly the key to bootstrapping a Laravel application. The application instance is created, the service providers are registered, 
    and the request is handed to the bootstrapped application. It's really that simple!

12. The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.

13. Class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.

14. Vendor directory where all composer dependencies are installed.

			Laravel Install & Setup

1. Laravel is an open-source PHP framework for web development. It's robust and easy to develop & understand. Creator - Taylor Otwell
   It follows the MVC architectural pattern and based on Symfony. Its architechtural patterns are majority based on Symfony.
   The source code of laravel is hosted on github.	

2. We need composer installed in our machine to install laravel. Composer is a PHP dependency manager or Package manager.
   a. Installation via Composer
	composer create-project laravel/laravel myApp
	composer create-project laravel/laravel="5.7.*" myApp
	composer create-project laravel/laravel="9.*" laravel9.5
	cd myApp
	php artisan serve
   b. Via laravel installer -- you may install the laravel as a global composer dependency.
	composer global require laravel/installer
	laravel new myApp
	cd myApp
	php artisan serve.
	
3. Laravel latest verion is 9 (yr-2022). Laravel5.4 onwards application structure (App directory tree structure) diffenrent than 5.3 & below. 
   Each folder is separated for MVC structure. 
	app/Http/Controller => Contains controller for our App
	app/Providers => Contains service providers.
	config  => Contains configurations for different areas like application,database,filesystem,mail,session,view,services and auth etc,.
	database => Contains Model related files. factories, migrations and seeds.
	resources => Contains views,css and js files. resources/views contains blade.php files with are linked with route and controller.
	routes => Contains route files for web and api. api.php and web.php
	vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate => Contains laravel core files.

4. All of the configuration files for Laravel framework are stored in the `config` directory.

5. Many important configuration values are defined using the .env file that exists at the root of your application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Interesting features of Laravel framework

1. MVC support
2. Built in Authentication & Authorization
3. Packaging System
4. Multiple File System
5. Artisan Console
6. Eloquent ORM
7. Templating Engine
8. Task Scheduling
9. WebSocket Programming

			Laravel Mail Sending
			
-- Laravel provides a clean, simple email API powered by the popular SwiftMailer library.
-- Laravel uses free feature-rich library SwiftMailer to send emails.
-- The e-mail templates are loaded in the same way as views, which means you can use the Blade syntax and inject data into your templates.


## Upto laravel5.2 version
Mail::send(string|array $view, array $data, Closure|string $callback);

//pass data into views
$data  = ["to"=>"nag123@gmail.com",name"=>"nag","place"=>"Hyderabad"];

//message builder instance $message
try{
    Mail::send('emails.welcome', $data, function($message) use ($data) {
        $message->to($data['to'])->subject(ucfirst(app()->env) . ' Customer Reset Password');
    });
} catch(\Exception $e){
    dd($e);
}

try {
      $data = array('sender_name'=>"Nagamaiah");
      $price = 999;
      $palce = 'hyderabad';
      Mail::send('mail', $data, function($message) use ($data,$price) {
         $message->to('nagamaiah63@gmail.com', 'Tutorials Point')->subject
            ($data['sender_name'].' Subject '.$price);
         $message->from('xyz@gmail.com','nag');
      });
      return response("mail sent successfully");

    } catch(\Exception $e) {
        dd($e);
    }


                
## From laravel5.3 onwards mailable classes introduced
-- Mailable classes introduced in laravel5.3 version.
	php artisan make:mail OrderShipped    App\Mail\OrderShipped.php

-- Generating Markdown Mailables   // Generates a mailable class and a markdown template
	php artisan make:mail OrderShipped --markdown=emails.orders.shipped	

-- All of a mailable class configuration is done in the 'build' method. 
   you may call various methods such as from, subject, view, and attach to configure the email's presentation and delivery.
-- pass an instance of your mailable class to the send method:

	Mail::to('nag123@gmail.com')->send(new OrderShipped($order));
	
	Mail::to($request->user())
        ->cc($moreUsers)
        ->bcc($evenMoreUsers)
        ->send(new OrderShipped($order));
        
-- Sending Mail Via A Specific Mailer
	Mail::mailer('postmark')
        ->to($request->user())
        ->send(new OrderShipped($order));
        			
			
## From 'laravel9' onwards we are using 'symfony/mailer' package to send mails.
-- Laravel provides a clean, simple email API powered by the popular Symfony Mailer component.
	Mail::to('example123@gmail.com')->send(new OrderShipped($order));    //  Mail facade  --> Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail
	 
	Mail::to($request->user())
        ->cc($moreUsers)
        ->bcc($evenMoreUsers)
        ->send(new OrderShipped($order));	 		

-- Mailable class configuration is done in several methods, including the envelope, content, and attachments methods.			
	Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Envelope
	Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Content
	Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Attachment
	Illuminate\Mail\Mailables\Headers			
			



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Laravel Http Client (guzzlehttp/guzzle package)  
			
-- Laravel provides Guzzle HTTP client, allowing you to quickly make outgoing HTTP requests to communicate with other web applications.
-- Earlier we used cURL(client url) to make http requests in php. Now we have improved package guzzle http client.
-- Laravel provides Http facade to make http requests using guzzlehttp/guzzle package.
-- The get method returns an instance of Illuminate\Http\Client\Response, which provides a variety of methods that may be used to inspect the response.
	static Response get(string $url, array|string|null $query = null)
	static Response post(string $url, array $data = [])
	
	$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
	$request = $client->get('http://testmyapi.com');  (or)
	
	use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;
	$response = Http::get('http://example.com');	
	
-- Response instance status code methods (Illuminate\Http\Client\Response)
	$response->ok() : bool;                  // 200 OK
	$response->created() : bool;             // 201 Created
	$response->accepted() : bool;            // 202 Accepted
	$response->noContent() : bool;           // 204 No Content
	$response->movedPermanently() : bool;    // 301 Moved Permanently
	$response->found() : bool;               // 302 Found
	$response->badRequest() : bool;          // 400 Bad Request
	$response->unauthorized() : bool;        // 401 Unauthorized
	$response->paymentRequired() : bool;     // 402 Payment Required
	$response->forbidden() : bool;           // 403 Forbidden
	$response->notFound() : bool;            // 404 Not Found
	$response->requestTimeout() : bool;      // 408 Request Timeout
	$response->conflict() : bool;            // 409 Conflict
	$response->unprocessableEntity() : bool; // 422 Unprocessable Entity
	$response->tooManyRequests() : bool;     // 429 Too Many Requests
	$response->serverError() : bool;         // 500 Internal Server Error

			Laravel Validation
			
			
			
			
			
			
						
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Laravel Packages

As a PHP developer, we must be familiar with how to use frameworks. Frameworks make the process of development easier by simplifying common
practices used in developing major web projects such as packages, modules, plugins, and even components. As of now, there are over 500 laravel
packages on. 

Most popular laravel packages:
1. Cashier
