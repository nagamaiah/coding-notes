-- Postgresql is an open-source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS). This means that, similar to Object-Oriented 
   programming languages, objects, classes, and inheritance are supported by PostgreSQL
-- PostgreSQL is preferred when a high level of security is required and the number of transactions or queries is large.
-- MySQL is a purely relational database. PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is an object-relational database. This means that in 
   PostgreSQL, you can store data as objects with properties.
-- Object identifiers (OIDs) are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys for various system tables.
-- By default, the Postgresql database listens on port 5432
