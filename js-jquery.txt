HTML nodelist using js
NodeList(3) [h3, h3, h3]
In JavaScript a NodeList is an array-like list of objects. One thing to remember though is that array methods will not work on a nodelist because it’s not an array!
In ES2015, we can use the Array.from method to convert a NodeList into an array.
We could also potentially Spread into an array and then map over that.
let myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll('h3')

let nodeListArr = Array.from(myNodeList)
let nodeListSpread = [...myNodeList]

console.log(nodeListArr);
console.log(nodeListSpread);


## Hoisting ::
1. Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope 
   (to the top of the current script or the current function).
2. Hoisting in Javascript is a mechanism in which the variables and function declarations (not initializations) are moved to the top of their scope before 
   the execution of the code. The function expressions and arrow functions cannot be hoisted. 
3. Hoisting allows you to use functions and variables before they're declared.
4. We can stop hoisting using the "use strict" directive at top; JavaScript strict mode does not allow (hoisting) undeclared variables.  





// break vs continue
// break - jump out of loop (or) terminate loop
// continue - skip the current iteration and continue with next iteration.


// prime number - A number which is divisible by itself and 1 is called prime nubmer
let result = [];
for(let i=1;i<=100;i++){
    let count = 0;
    if(i<2){
        continue;
    }
    for(let j=1;j<=i;j++)
    {
        if(i%j == 0){
            count++
        }
    }
    if(count == 2){
        result.push(i);
    }
}
console.log(result);

// palidrome number - A number remains the same when its digits are reversed vise versa is called palidrome number.
// use string reverse and compare.

// armstrong number -  An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. 
// 153 = 1^3+5^3+3^3   //153, 370, 371, 407 
// 9474 = 9^4+4^4+7^4+4^4



// event bubbling and event capturing


// e.target  vs e.currentTarget

Events are actions that are perfomed by client on DOM elements
DOM events pass an Event object as an argument to the event handler functions.



// e.preventDefault vs e.stopPropagation
