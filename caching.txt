					Caching

-- Types of memory in computer
	1. Primary Memory or Main Memory (RAM) -- Random Access Memory -- Volatile -- data cleared when turned off		
	2. Seconday Memory or Permanent Storage (ROM) -- Read Only Memory -- Non-Volatile -- data not cleared even turned off
-- Caching is a common technique in modern computing to enhance system performance and reduce RESPONSE time.
-- Caching is a technique where we store the frequently accessed data in temporary memory or space to make it readily available and reduce the 
   workload for our application, server, or database.

-- Cache Hit : If the requested data found in cache
-- Cache Miss : If the requested data not found in cache
-- Eviction Policy : We clear all cache data using TTL (time to live) to overcome cache overflow(full) issue.

# Types of caching mechanisms
1. Browser Caching

2. Web Server Caching

3. CDN Caching
-- Improve the delivery speed to static content like images, web pages, video
-- CDNs improve web page load times by bringing service near to the user
-- CDNs offer scalability and availability
-- Reduce latency by skipping the original server and serving from CDN
-- A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. 
   The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.
-- Types of CDN : 
	Pull based (Good for small size data.)
	Push based (Good for larger files. Manual intervention is required)
-- Available CDN platforms in the market : Akamai, Amazon Cloud Front, Cloudflare


4. Distributed Caching 
-- Traditional caching memory is limited to one machine, in distributed caching memory can be scale out to linking multiple machine. 




# Full Page Cache
-- `Full page cache` means that the entire HTML output for the page will be cached. Subsequent requests for the page will return the cached
   HTML instead of trying to process and re-build the page, thus returning a response to the browser much faster.
-- Magento 2 full page cache is the free built-in Magento 2 caching solution that allows you to reduce the server load time and improves 
   the response time due to the fast loading of CMS, product, and catalog pages.
