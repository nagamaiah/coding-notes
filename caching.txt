					Caching
					
-- Caching is a common technique in modern computing to enhance system performance and reduce RESPONSE time.


# Full Page Cache
-- `Full page cache` means that the entire HTML output for the page will be cached. Subsequent requests for the page will return the cached
   HTML instead of trying to process and re-build the page, thus returning a response to the browser much faster.
-- Magento 2 full page cache is the free built-in Magento 2 caching solution that allows you to reduce the server load time and improves 
   the response time due to the fast loading of CMS, product, and catalog pages.
