HTML nodelist using js
NodeList(3) [h3, h3, h3]
In JavaScript a NodeList is an array-like list of objects. One thing to remember though is that array methods will not work on a nodelist because it’s not an array!
In ES2015, we can use the Array.from method to convert a NodeList into an array.
We could also potentially Spread into an array and then map over that.
let myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll('h3')

let nodeListArr = Array.from(myNodeList)
let nodeListSpread = [...myNodeList]

console.log(nodeListArr);
console.log(nodeListSpread);
