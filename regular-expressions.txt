					Regular Expressions

-- Regular Expressions are used to find pattern matching (or) string matching (sequence characters i.e string).
-- Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, 
   log files, spreadsheets, or even documents. 
-- Used for email, password, US phone, US zip validations.
-- Back slash is used to escape in-built characters i.e   \. \- \*


-- [fgh] Character Set
-- [^hkj] negate Character Set
-- (word|curd) Grouping
-- (^word) negate Grouping


Regex Metacharacters (short forms)
.       - Any Character Except New Line
\d      - Digit (0-9)  -> [0-9]
\D      - Not a Digit (0-9) --> [^0-9]
\w      - Word Character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)  --> [a-zA-Z0-9_]
\W      - Not a Word Character
\s      - Whitespace (space, tab, newline)
\S      - Not Whitespace (space, tab, newline)


\b      - Word Boundary
\B      - Not a Word Boundary
^       - Beginning of a String
$       - End of a String


[]      - Matches Characters in brackets 
[^ ]    - Matches Characters NOT in brackets
|       - Either Or  "/(b|c|r)at/d" 
( )     - Group


Quantifiers: (perform repetitions)
*       - 0 or More 
+       - 1 or More
?       - 0 or One
{3}     - Exact Number (or) no of digits i.e 3 times
{3,4}   - Range of Numbers (Minimum, Maximum)
{n,}	  - n or More


{n} specify n no. of digits

-- PCRE functions
-- "Perl Compatible Regular Expressions" is a library written in C, which implements a regular expression engine, 
   inspired by the capabilities of the Perl programming language.
-- grep - Global Regular Expression Print
-- Grep is a command line utility in Unix and Linux systems. It is used for finding a search patterns in the content of a given file

1. preg_match(
    string $pattern,
    string $subject,
    array &$matches = null,
    int $flags = 0,
    int $offset = 0
): int|false

Used to check single match. For all matches use preg_match_all.

There is no modifier g for preg_match. Instead, you have to use the preg_match_all function.
